The goal of this game is to collect all of the modules hidden underneath the snow.

Snow can be shot down but the uncovered ground can spawn enemies. Snow can also drop material that can be used to build supporting structures:

Barricade - obstacle that can be destroyed by enemies
Wall - cannot be destroyed by enemies but can decay over time
Floor - can recharge energy and prevents spawning of enemies

Do not loose health or energy! Energy can be gained from docking stations (two in the map) or from built floor tiles.
